NOW
[X] fix delegate methods to include port and stop using a dictionary
[ ] remove observer in port list
[ ] change name of designated initializer for port
[ ] stop retaining delegate
[ ] use properties for port bsdPath/name/type/properties
[ ] use an NSError with -commitChanges

LATER
[ ] investigate phantom newline-only data
[ ] investigate phantom issue with runaway kernel task / hang maxing out a core on replug
    seems like a race condition, try to open as the system brings the port up
